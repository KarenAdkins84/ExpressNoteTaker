# Express.js Note Taker

## User Story
AS A small business owner
I WANT to be able to write and save notes
SO THAT I can organize my thoughts and keep track of tasks I need to complete

## Description
This project had starter code that had already built the front-end, so I connected the front-end with the back-end with express.js middleware. I created an html route and an api route that returns the proper files and saves the user's notes.

## Technolgies and Languages Used
Express.js
node.js
HTML
CSS
Javascript
